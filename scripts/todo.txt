Source Localization TODO

*** Check individual evoked data for both experiments, visually inspect evoked potentials
  *** check with whitening - 2 noise covs
# Check residuals for source estimate data - both cov mats, dSPM, MNE
# run preprocessing steps on the epoched files (download updated code from GitLab)
# regress ET coefficients (?)
# make jupyter notebook from cluster-stats results (save stc with clusters)
  # rerun stats with looser initial p
# upload code to github
# make summary
# read lit
